## Inspiration 💡
The team was inspired to create CommunityCalendar after seeing a need in one of their own communities for a centralized location for events happening in their local community. We saw this as an opportunity to foster relationship-building by providing an easy way for people to get involved locally.

## What it does 🤔
CommunityCalendar allows users to view events happening in their area, as well as add events that they're hosting. The ability for individuals to add their own events makes CommunityCalendar the best way to see all events happening locally, whether it's hosted by an individual, an organization or the lcoal government.

## How we built it 🎨

## Design 🎨

## Challenges we ran into 😤
Our team members learned new libraries and worked with new technologies. We familiarized ourselves with aspects of full stack development that we previously had no experience with. We also collaborated from four different time zones, which was challenging to find a time to work together.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of ✨
We're very proud of learning to work with React Redux and MongoDB, as well as figuring out how to use react-big-calendar to work well for our purposes.
